# Spotify Social+

🎧 A Chrome extension that brings back the **Spotify Friend Activity** sidebar — now in a popup.

Inspired by the retired Spotify desktop feature and extended with a sleek, hoverable UI and future social features like liking, commenting, and adding to playlists.

## 🔍 Features

- View what your friends are currently listening to on Spotify
- Shows track, artist, context (playlist/album), and profile picture
- Tracks real-time listening activity using Spotify’s internal API
- Hoverable friend cards with a fixed header and smooth UI
- Popup-based — doesn’t modify Spotify’s main interface

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This project uses the token-sniffing strategy pioneered by [jackweatherford/spotify-friend-activity](https://github.com/jackweatherford/spotify-friend-activity) to access Spotify's internal friend activity API.
